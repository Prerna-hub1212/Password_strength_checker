The Password Strength Checker (GUI) is a Python-based desktop application that evaluates the strength of a user-entered password based on commonly accepted cybersecurity standards. The application provides real-time feedback, classifies passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong, and suggests improvements to enhance password security.

This project was developed to understand secure authentication practices, password policies, and basic cybersecurity concepts, while also gaining hands-on experience with GUI application development using Tkinter.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze password strength using multiple security parameters

To educate users on creating strong and secure passwords

To demonstrate practical cybersecurity concepts in a beginner-friendly project

To build a resume-ready GUI application using Python

🖥️ Application Features

Secure password input (hidden characters)

Strength evaluation based on:

Password length

Uppercase letters

Lowercase letters

Numbers

Special characters

Color-coded strength indicator:

🔴 Weak

🟠 Medium

🟢 Strong

Clear suggestions for improving weak passwords

Simple, clean, and user-friendly GUI

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

Programming Language: Python 3

GUI Framework: Tkinter

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS

🔍 Password Strength Evaluation Criteria

The password is evaluated using the following rules:

Criteria	Description
Length	Minimum 8 characters
Uppercase	At least one uppercase letter (A–Z)
Lowercase	At least one lowercase letter (a–z)
Numbers	At least one numeric digit (0–9)
Special Characters	At least one symbol (@ # $ % & !)

Each satisfied rule contributes to the overall strength score.

📊 Strength Classification Logic

Weak: Meets 0–2 criteria

Medium: Meets 3–4 criteria

Strong: Meets all 5 criteria

Based on the result, the application provides custom improvement suggestions.
